<p style="color: purple; margin: 0 100px 0 100px; font size: 1.5em;" > A static song humming in my head
I saw myself in an empty bed
It's been so long but I won't forget
The morning sun

When the bells start to ring out, beckoning
We don't want to get up, back to sleep
We could fuck around if you wanna, watching me
Take away all the covers, it's all you need

I'm gonna wait for you forever
I'm gonna wait for you forever
Until the sun burns out, we're tethered
I'm gonna wait for you forever
Forever

The cherry trees filling my lungs up
They spoke to me in a broken tongue
Said come and see, so I climbed on up
Up to the leaves

When the bells start to ring out, deafening
And I don't want to get up, let me sleep
We could fuck around if you wanna, watching me
You run away all the colors, abandoning

I'm gonna wait for you forever
I'm gonna wait for you forever
Until the sun burns out, we're tethered
I'm gonna wait for you forever
Forever

No one awake and nope I don't breathe
Only so much that a heart can bleed
So I go back to the cherry trees
Where I'm away for you, hanami

No one awake and nope I don't breathe
Only so much that a heart can bleed
So I go back to the cherry trees
Where I'm away for you, hanami

No one awake and nope I don't breathe
Only so much that a heart can bleed
So I go back to the cherry trees
Where I'm away for you, hanami </p>
