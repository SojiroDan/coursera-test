A static song humming in my head<br>
I saw myself in an empty bed<br>
It's been so long but I won't forget<br>
The morning sun<br>
<br>
When the bells start to ring out, beckoning<br>
We don't want to get up, back to sleep<br>
We could fuck around if you wanna, watching me<br>
Take away all the covers, it's all you need<br>
<br>
I'm gonna wait for you forever<br>
I'm gonna wait for you forever<br>
Until the sun burns out, we're tethered<br>
I'm gonna wait for you forever<br>
Forever<br>
<br>
The cherry trees filling my lungs up<br>
They spoke to me in a broken tongue<br>
Said come and see, so I climbed on up<br>
Up to the leaves<br>
<br>
When the bells start to ring out, deafening<br>
And I don't want to get up, let me sleep<br>
We could fuck around if you wanna, watching me<br>
You run away all the colors, abandoning<br>
<br>
I'm gonna wait for you forever<br>
I'm gonna wait for you forever<br>
Until the sun burns out, we're tethered<br>
I'm gonna wait for you forever<br>
Forever<br>
<br>
No one awake and nope I don't breathe<br>
Only so much that a heart can bleed<br>
So I go back to the cherry trees<br>
Where I'm away for you, hanami<br>
<br>
No one awake and nope I don't breathe<br>
Only so much that a heart can bleed<br>
So I go back to the cherry trees<br>
Where I'm away for you, hanami<br>
<br>
No one awake and nope I don't breathe<br>
Only so much that a heart can bleed<br>
So I go back to the cherry trees<br>
Where I'm away for you, hanami
